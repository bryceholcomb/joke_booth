# Joke Booth

This Ruby on Rails application was built in under three hours for the 2015 Quick
Left Humor Hackfest. It won second place in the competition. The judging
criteria was based on completeness, ability to take to market, and ability to
help make people more humorous and in turn the world a funnier place.

The application allows users to submit their own joke content to be peer reviewed and deemed
"funny" or "not funny".
